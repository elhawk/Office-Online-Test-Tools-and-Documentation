AddActivities
=============

..  default-domain:: http

..  post:: /wopi/files/(file_id)/activities

    The |operation| operation sends activities about the file to the host.  The host can use these activities to send users notifications about
    their documents -- for instance, that someone made comments.  The host can also choose to store these activities to enable an activity feed,
    or other features based on knowledge of past activities.

    ..  include:: /_fragments/common_params.rst

    :reqheader X-WOPI-Override:
        The **string** ``ADD_ACTIVITIES``. Required.

    :code 200: Success
    :code 400: Couldn't deserialize request. Should not be returned for activities of unknown type, even if the batch contained zero activities of known types.
    :code 401: Invalid :term:`access token`
    :code 404: Resource not found/user unauthorized
    :code 500: Server error
    :code 501: AddActivities is not supported

Request
-------

The request for an |operation| call is JSON (as specified in :rfc:`4627`) containing a single required property:

Activities
    An **array** of activity objects, defined below.

..  include:: /_fragments/activities/activity_object.rst
..  include:: /_fragments/activities/comment_activity.rst

People
~~~~~~

Activities may refer to people besides the activity's creator (inferred from the access token). These people are represented by a person object.
This person object may come from the host via SearchPeople, or it may come from the document content such as comment author information.
In the latter case, we might not have any information but the user's name.  Clients should send as much information as they have.

..  include:: /_fragments/person_object.rst

Here is a sample request consisting of three activities: one simple comment, one comment reply that includes a mention, and a mention in the body of the document:
